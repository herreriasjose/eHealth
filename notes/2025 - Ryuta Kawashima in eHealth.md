# Ryuta Kawashima in eHealth

Ryuta Kawashima, born on May 23, 1959, in Chiba, Japan, is a neuroscientist renowned for his research in neurophysiology and brain imaging, focusing on mapping brain regions associated with emotions, language, memory, and cognition. He graduated in medicine from Tohoku University and worked as a visiting researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden before returning to Tohoku, where he is now a full professor. His work has had a significant impact on applied neuroscience, especially through his collaboration with Nintendo on the *Brain Age* series, known in some markets as *Brain Training*.

#### Research Findings

Kawashima has explored how mental activities can influence the development and maintenance of cognitive functions, particularly in children, the elderly, and patients with cognitive decline. One of his most prominent studies, published in 2001, analyzed brain activity during video game play, concluding that such games did not stimulate the frontal lobes—regions associated with higher functions like learning and emotional regulation. This study, conducted at Tohoku University, suggested that this lack of stimulation could potentially affect brain development and behavioral control, although it did not find direct evidence of permanent damage. The finding was reported in media outlets such as [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/19/games.schools), raising concerns about the impact on teenagers.

Later, his work shifted toward developing brain training games. In 2003, he published the book *Train Your Brain: 60 Days to a Better Brain*, which inspired the *Brain Age* series for Nintendo DS, released in 2005. Subsequent studies, such as one conducted between March and August 2010 in Sendai, Japan, assessed the impact of *Brain Age* on elderly individuals through a double-blind trial. The results, published in [PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029676), showed improvements in executive functions and processing speed after four weeks of gameplay, with participants playing for about 15 minutes a day, at least five days a week. Another 2013 study, also found in [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3566110/), reported similar benefits in young adults, improving executive functions, working memory, and processing speed when compared to playing *Tetris*.

However, these benefits appear to be specific to the trained tasks. For instance, a controlled but unpublished trial mentioned in [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2223056/) showed benefits in auditory memory for a *Brain Age*-related program in people over 65 over 8–10 weeks, but the improvements did not generalize to other cognitive domains.

#### Criticism and Controversy

The 2001 study on video games received significant criticism. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryuta_Kawashima), scientists broadly dismissed it due to the lack of direct evidence of permanent brain damage and for making potentially exaggerated claims about the impact on brain development and behavior. Articles such as one in [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2538-video-game-brain-damage-claim-criticised/) in 2002 reinforced this criticism, expressing skepticism about Kawashima’s claims.

As for *Brain Age*, scientific reviews have been more nuanced but equally critical regarding the generalization of its benefits. The 2016 review by Daniel J. Simons et al., published in [Psychological Science in the Public Interest](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1529100616661983), analyzed 374 studies cited by brain training companies and found little evidence for improvements in unrelated tasks or everyday cognitive performance. Although *Brain Age* is not mentioned explicitly, the conclusion that brain training improves only trained tasks and lacks broader transfer applies. This aligns with the consensus from the Stanford Center on Longevity in 2014 ([Stanford Center](https://longevity.stanford.edu/a-consensus-on-the-brain-training-industry-from-the-scientific-community-2/)), which stated that claims of general cognitive improvement are frequently exaggerated, with effects that are small, narrow, and short-lived.

Michael Marsiske, cited in [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2223056/), compared the benefits of *Brain Age* to physical exercise, suggesting that just as training your biceps doesn't strengthen your legs, the improvements are specific and don’t translate into overall cognitive efficiency. Additionally, Nintendo does not cite scientific literature to support *Brain Age*’s benefits, according to Simons’ review, and experimental attempts to verify Kawashima’s claims have produced mixed results with small effect sizes, as noted in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Age:_Train_Your_Brain_in_Minutes_a_Day%21).

In summary, while Kawashima’s studies have shown specific benefits in cognitive functions, critics point to the lack of generalization, methodological flaws in some studies, and exaggerated commercial claims, reflecting ongoing debate in the scientific community about the real effectiveness of brain training games.

#### Conclusion

Some studies, like the 2010 one in Japan, suggest that playing *Brain Age* for four weeks may improve executive functions and processing speed in elderly individuals. However, these benefits seem limited to specific tasks and do not easily translate to general improvements in everyday life.

His 2001 study, which claimed video games do not stimulate the frontal lobes and might impact brain development, was heavily criticized. Scientists pointed out the lack of direct evidence of permanent damage. Scientific reviews, such as that of Daniel J. Simons in 2016, have found that brain training games—including *Brain Age*—improve the trained tasks but provide no solid proof of broad cognitive benefits, and many studies suffer from methodological weaknesses.

In short, Kawashima’s work appears to have a limited and specific impact, with prominent criticisms about the lack of generalization and scientific rigor in some cases.
