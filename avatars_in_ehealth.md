# Avatars in eHealth for Patient Communication

**Avatars in digital health** refer to virtual agents with a human-like (or mascot) appearance that interact with patients on eHealth platforms. These avatars act as a **communicative interface** between the digital health system and the user, making the interaction more **personalized, empathetic, and accessible** than a traditional interface. Their use has expanded across mental health, telemedicine, virtual assistance, and other areas of eHealth, playing communicative roles ranging from therapeutic guide, health coach, **emotional companion**, and even virtual friend. Below, we explore current examples (commercial platforms) and academic findings on the use of avatars in digital health, with a focus on how they enhance patient-system communication.

## Current Platforms Using Avatars in Digital Health

### Mental Health Apps with Chatbots/Avatars
Several mental health apps include conversational avatars that act as **virtual therapists** or **empathetic companions**. For example:

- **Wysa** (a penguin avatar chatbot) and **Woebot** (a friendly robot chatbot) interact with users using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques, offering guidance, exercises, and 24/7 emotional support.

- Research shows that users can form a **perceived therapeutic alliance** with these virtual agents, including feelings of trust and personification of the avatar.

- A clinical trial with Woebot showed that two weeks of conversation with the avatar led to **significant reductions in depressive symptoms** in young adults with mild/moderate depression.

- One key communication benefit is **availability and anonymity**: patients may open up more easily to avatars due to the lack of perceived judgment.

- Recent studies found that **30% of individuals prefer discussing negative experiences with a VR avatar** rather than a person.

- Apps like **Youper** use conversational AI to monitor mood and offer therapeutic techniques, adapting responses as they "learn" from the user.

### Virtual Nurse Avatars and Assistants in Telemedicine
In general healthcare and chronic disease management, platforms use **nurse-like avatars** to communicate with patients at home:

- **Sensely** employs **"Molly,"** a *virtual nurse* who converses daily with patients suffering from congestive heart failure, guiding symptom checks, education, and medication reminders.

- Using voice recognition and natural language, Molly assists with self-care and escalates alerts when needed. She mimics compassionate behavior like nodding.

- **Florence**, adopted by the WHO and other organizations, is a chatbot-style nurse that sends medication reminders and tracks weight, mood, etc., via platforms like Messenger or WhatsApp.

- These avatars **personalize** communication and offer continuous support, enhancing the **patient experience**.

### Companion Avatars and Health Coaches
For vulnerable populations like older adults, avatars serve as **virtual companions** to combat loneliness and support adherence:

- **CareCoach** features a *digital pet avatar* (cat or dog) that chats with older adults, reminds them of routines, and alerts caregivers when needed.

- Users report feelings of **companionship** ("I tell it when I leave or come home") and motivation to stay active.

- Pilot studies showed that these avatars reduce loneliness and depressive symptoms—some reporting 3x less loneliness and a 25% drop in depression scales.

## Academic Findings on Avatars in eHealth

Research on avatars in digital health is growing and provides evidence of **communicative benefits** and challenges:

- A narrative review identified multiple **therapeutic uses** of avatars:
  - Multi-user virtual environments with patient avatars.
  - Fully virtual therapies with both patient and therapist as avatars.
  - Hybrid therapies that complement face-to-face sessions.
  - Avatars integrated in *serious games*.
  - Autonomous virtual therapists driven by AI.

- Avatars help establish a **virtual therapeutic alliance**, reduce communication barriers (due to perceived anonymity), and encourage patients to express or explore identity safely.

- Avatars can **enhance intervention adherence**. Studies show users stay engaged longer with apps that use avatars.

- Patients sometimes **prefer interacting with avatars** for sensitive topics or when they want information repeated without judgment.

### Example: Avatar Therapy for Psychosis

An experimental therapy for schizophrenia uses an avatar representing the patient’s hallucinatory voice. The patient designs the face and voice of the hallucination, and a therapist speaks through the avatar. Over time, the avatar shifts from hostile to conciliatory, restoring the patient’s sense of control.

- A randomized controlled trial published in *The Lancet Psychiatry* showed that 12 weeks of avatar therapy led to **significant reductions in hallucination frequency and intensity**.

## Ethical and Practical Considerations

- Avatars must convey **accurate health information** and ensure **data privacy**.

- While avatars are empathetic, they **do not replace** human clinical judgment.

- Their best role is as a **complement** to human professionals—automating repetitive tasks while clinicians focus on nuanced care.

## Conclusion

Avatars are emerging as **valuable communication tools in eHealth**, across mental health, telemedicine, and digital companionship. Their **communicative role**—providing guidance, empathy, or emotional support—has improved patient engagement and comfort. Peer-reviewed studies support the idea that avatars foster **virtual therapeutic alliances**, improve **treatment adherence**, and reduce **communication barriers**. As AI and interface design evolve, avatars will become more **realistic, interactive, and personalized**, further expanding their adoption in clinical settings. Nonetheless, a **patient-centered, ethical integration** remains crucial—avatars should **enhance** human care, not replace it.
